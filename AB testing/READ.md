##  Case Study 
as a newly hired junior analyst for one of the CX labs. the job is to prepare a read out on a digital experiment. The experiment was designed as an A/B test with a measurement period of 3/15/2017 â€“ 4/30/2017. Research conducted by the lab revealed a hypothesis: a more modern UI and in-context prompts would make clients feel more comfortable with the process. The team further believed that clients would complete the new process at a higher rate. In the experiment, the control group was exposed to the current state experience while the test group saw a newly redesigned experience with improved UI, navigation, and in-line help. Both the test and control experiences have the same number of process steps (start page, steps 1-3, and then a confirm page, which indicates completion of the process). 
There are three data sets for this case study: 
1) Data set 1 (df_final_demo) contains client demographic information 
2) Data set 2 (df_final_web_data) contains web hit level web activity (split into 2 parts: pt_1 and pt_2) 
3) Data set 3 (df_final_experiment_clients) contains a list of clients and indicates whether they were a part of the experiment 





Tomek links are pairs of very close instances, but of opposite classes. Removing the instances of the majority class of each pair increases the space between the two classes, facilitating the classification process.![tomek1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/103430199/166903817-e83c42d2-b83c-4f93-8fc0-1f3352c5b008.png)
