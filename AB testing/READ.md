##  Case Study 
as a newly hired junior analyst for one of the CX labs. the job is to prepare a read out on a digital experiment. The experiment was designed as an A/B test with a measurement period of 3/15/2017 â€“ 4/30/2017. Research conducted by the lab revealed a hypothesis: a more modern UI and in-context prompts would make clients feel more comfortable with the process. The team further believed that clients would complete the new process at a higher rate. In the experiment, the control group was exposed to the current state experience while the test group saw a newly redesigned experience with improved UI, navigation, and in-line help. Both the test and control experiences have the same number of process steps (start page, steps 1-3, and then a confirm page, which indicates completion of the process). 
There are three data sets for this case study: 
1) Data set 1 (df_final_demo) contains client demographic information 
2) Data set 2 (df_final_web_data) contains web hit level web activity (split into 2 parts: pt_1 and pt_2) 
3) Data set 3 (df_final_experiment_clients) contains a list of clients and indicates whether they were a part of the experiment 


## Result 
calculating the winning design we can come to conclusion that the test variation was a success in regard to the control.![ABCONVERSIONRATE](https://github.com/lado007/ironjohn/blob/main/AB%20testing/visualization/AB_conversion.png)
