- steps to follow
Load the dataset and explore the variables.
Extract the target variable.
Extract the independent variables and scale them.
Build the logistic regression model.
Evaluate the model.
- Applying different measures of accuracy and data imbalance to improve and evaluate the model
Synthetic Minority Oversampling TEchnique (SMOTE) is an over sampling technique based on nearest neighbors that adds new points between existing points. 
Tomek links are pairs of very close instances, but of opposite classes. Removing the instances of the majority class of each pair increases the space between the two classes, facilitating the classification process.
