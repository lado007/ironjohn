Synthetic Minority Oversampling TEchnique (SMOTE) is an over sampling technique based on nearest neighbors that adds new points between existing points. ![smoth](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/103430199/166903554-3905169e-4b5e-4497-a838-3476a3ba25d5.png)


Tomek links are pairs of very close instances, but of opposite classes. Removing the instances of the majority class of each pair increases the space between the two classes, facilitating the classification process.![tomek1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/103430199/166903817-e83c42d2-b83c-4f93-8fc0-1f3352c5b008.png)
